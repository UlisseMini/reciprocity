            <p style="margin: 10px 0; line-height: 1.6;">This app only helps with the initial step of expressing mutual interest in deeper support. <strong>Ongoing communication about boundaries and needs is essential.</strong> Your wellbeing as a supporter is crucial - not just for you, but for maintaining the trust that makes this relationship work. When someone shares their struggles with you, <strong>they're trusting that you'll take care of yourself and communicate your limits honestly.</strong> This trust is what allows them to seek support without fear of burdening you. If they sense you're overextending or taking responsibility for outcomes beyond your control, they may withdraw to protect you, leaving them more isolated. <strong>Your role is to offer presence and listening; their healing remains their responsibility.</strong></p>

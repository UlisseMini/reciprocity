            <p style="margin: 10px 0; line-height: 1.6;">This app is for people who want to be part of each other's support network during difficult times. When you're feeling deregulated - whether from depression, anxiety attacks, or just having a really bad day - sometimes you need someone to talk to who can help you get back to a better place.</p>
            <p style="margin: 10px 0; line-height: 1.6; font-weight: bold;">If you check the option below, you're saying you'd be honored to have that kind of relationship with this person - both them calling you when they need support, and being okay to call them when you need it. If you both check each other, you match and both know you have mutual support!</p>

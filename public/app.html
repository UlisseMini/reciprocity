            <h2>Support Network</h2>
            <p style="margin: 10px 0; line-height: 1.6;">This app is for people who want to be part of each other's support network during difficult times. When you're feeling deregulated - whether from depression, anxiety attacks, or just having a really bad day - sometimes you need someone to talk to who can help you get back to a better place. The value is forming closer relationships where you don't worry about imposing on each other.</p>
            <p style="margin: 10px 0; line-height: 1.6; font-style: italic; color: #666;">This app only helps with the initial step of expressing mutual interest in deeper support. Ongoing communication about boundaries and needs is essential. Your wellbeing as a supporter is crucial - not just for you, but for maintaining the trust that makes this relationship work. When someone shares their struggles with you, they're trusting that you'll take care of yourself and communicate your limits honestly. This trust is what allows them to seek support without fear of burdening you. If they sense you're overextending or taking responsibility for outcomes beyond your control, they may withdraw to protect you, leaving them more isolated. Your role is to offer presence and listening; their healing remains their responsibility.</p>
            <p style="margin: 10px 0; line-height: 1.6; font-weight: bold;">If you check the option below, you're saying you'd be honored to have that kind of relationship with this person - both supporting them when they need it, and being open to reaching out to them when you need support (without worrying about imposing). If you both check each other, you match and both know you have mutual support!</p>
